# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis

1. Project Overview

   - Use case: Understand how customers shop (e.g., transaction frequency, types of products, buying patterns) to help marketing/sales teams.

   - Scope: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL queries, statistical inference, dashboarding.

   - Goal: Provide actionable insights and visualization for decision making.

2. Methodology

    - Data cleaning & preparation – Handle missing values, convert types, derive new features (e.g., total spend, frequency, days since last purchase).

    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions, correlations, segment customers by behaviour.

    - SQL analysis – Use the SQL script to generate aggregated tables and metrics (customer lifetime value, recurring purchase rate, segment counts).

    - Dashboard creation – Use Power BI (Customer Behaviour Dashboard.pbix) to build interactive visualisations for stakeholders.

    - Interpretation & Insight – Derive key findings and recommend next steps from the data.
  

  3. Technologies Used

     - Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – for data cleaning & EDA
     - SQL – for aggregation, segmentation and structured queries
     - Power BI – for dashboarding & visualization
